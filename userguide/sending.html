<h2 id="design">Designing New Products</h2>

<h3>What is a Product?</h3>

<p>A product is a specific version of any content produced in
response to an earthquake, information about an earthquake, or another
product.</p>

<p>A product usually consists of a directory of files, but may also
include a stream of bytes, links to internet resources, and key/value
pairs.</p>


<h4>Product IDs</h4>
<p>The source, type, and code uniquely identify a product and its
associated content. Update times indicate different versions of the same
product, and products with more recent update times supersede products
with less recent update times.</p>

<dl>
	<dt>source</dt>
	<dd>The product creator. Usually a network code.</dd>

	<dt>type</dt>
	<dd>The type of product. Multiple sources may create the same type
	of product.</dd>

	<dt>code</dt>
	<dd>A unique code, for a given <code>source</code> and <code>type</code>
	combination.</dd>

	<dt>update time</dt>
	<dd>When this version of content was created. Two products with
	the same <code>source</code>, <code>type</code>, and <code>code</code>,
	but different <code>update time</code>s are different versions of the
	same product.</dd>
</dl>


<h4>Status</h4>
<p>A brief status code. Typically <code>UPDATE</code> or <code>DELETE</code>.
Any value that is not <code>DELETE</code> is considered an update.</p>

<p>When a product producer deletes a product they send an update
with a status <code>DELETE</code>, which is distributed like any other
product.</p>


<h4>Contents</h4>

<strong>Files</strong>
<p>Contents are optional, but are usually present when the status is
not <code>DELETE</code>. Each content has a path, which corresponds to a
filename.</p>

<strong>Non file content</strong>
<p>Each product may have one piece of content that is a stream of
bytes. It has an empty path and isn't stored in a file. Typically this
content is read from standard input, and also delivered to consumers via
standard input.</p>


<h4>Metadata</h4>

<strong>Links</strong>
<p>A product may include links to other products and resources.
Links have a relation, which speci√ûes how the resource is related to the
product. There may be multiple links for each type of relation.</p>

<strong>Properties</strong>
<p>Key value pairs. Each property may only have one value. These can
be used to determine whether further processing is required. "Standard"
properties include:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>eventsource</dt>
	<dd>network code of related event</dd>

	<dt>eventsourcecode</dt>
	<dd>network event code of related event</dd>

	<dt>eventtime</dt>
	<dd>time of related event</dd>

	<dt>latitude</dt>
	<dd>latitude of related event</dd>

	<dt>longitude</dt>
	<dd>longitude of related event</dd>

	<dt>maximum-latitude</dt>
	<dd>for space-bounded products, the upper latitude bound</dd>

	<dt>minimum-latitude</dt>
	<dd>for space-bounded products, the lower latitude bound</dd>

	<dt>maximum-longitude</dt>
	<dd>for space-bounded products, the upper longitude bound</dd>

	<dt>minimum-longitude</dt>
	<dd>for space-bounded products, the lower longitude bound</dd>

	<dt>start-time</dt>
	<dd>for time-bounded products, the start time</dd>

	<dt>end-time</dt>
	<dd>for time-bounded products, the start time</dd>

	<dt>depth</dt>
	<dd>depth of related event</dd>

	<dt>magnitude</dt>
	<dd>magnitude of related event</dd>

	<dt>version</dt>
	<dd>producer product version. This is not used for ordering
	products, which use update time as a versions.</dd>
</dl>

<p>All of these properties are optional, but a combination of either
<code>eventsource</code> and <code>eventsourcecode</code> OR <code>eventtime</code>,
<code>latitude</code>, and <code>longitude</code> are recommended for
event-related products for association purposes. The inclusion of any of the
time- or space-bounding properties will make products searchable using these extents.</p>


<h4>Signature</h4>
<p>Producers generate a signature which may be verified by both hubs
and consumers. The signature consists of a hash of all product contents
and attributes, which is encrypted using a private key and verified
using a public key.</p>

<p>Production hubs require a signature, and a keypair must be
registered before products are sent.</p>


<h3 id="content">Generating a &ldquo;Good&rdquo; Product</h3>
<p>The information contained in this section is a recommendation,
not a requirement however recommendations can be seen as a best practice
when generating new products.</p>

<h4 id="content_props">Product Properties</h4>
<p>Properties should be defined for important attributes of your
product. They allow recipients to quickly determine whether they should
process a product, without extensive parsing.</p>

<p>For example, <code>eventsource</code> and <code>eventsourcecode</code>
are used by the indexer to associate a product with an event. Other
examples include <code>dyfi</code> number of responses, <code>losspager</code>
alert level, and <code>shakemap</code> maximum MMI.</p>

<p><a href="./products/index.html">See the product documentation for other examples of
product properties.</a></p>

<h4 id="content_xml">Contents.xml File</h4>
<p>It is recommended you include with your product a
&ldquo;contents.xml&rdquo; file. This file describes all of the contents
you are sending with your product. It helps the web page to better
display your product and ultimately determines what content users will
be able to easily download from the web site.</p>
<p>The contents.xml file format is defined with a <a
	href="contents.xsd">contents.xsd</a> file. You must understand how to
read <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/schema/" target="_blank">XML
schema (XSD)</a> files in order to properly generate a contents.xml file.</p>


<h4>Grouping Content</h4>
<p>When mapping products into PDL, it is important to consider how
content is generated and updated when deciding what individual products
should contain.
<p>For event-related products, the group of content is everything
related to that event.</p>

<p>For non-event-related products, the group depends more on how
content is generated and updated. For example, station related content
might be broken up by station. It's possible that this content would
need to be further divided based on update intervals.</p>

<h4>Product Code Conventions</h4>
<p>A product <code>code</code> must be unique forever, from the same
<code>source</code> and <code>type</code>. Product creators also reuse
the <code>code</code> to update or delete the product.</p>

<p>For event-related products, an eventid makes a good code because
it also must be unique forever. Examples include : <code>us2011abcd</code>
and <code>nc12345678</code>.</p>

<p>For non-event-related products another ID scheme is required.
Timestamps are often useful in this situation when the products are
related to a time window.</p>

<p>An internal database key <em>can</em> be used.

</dl>


<h3>Send Examples</h3>

<h4>Sending or Updating a Product</h4>
<p>Sending a new product is the same as sending an update to a
product.</p>

<p><em>Line continuation characters (\) added for readability,
all arguments would appear on one line.</em></p>

<div class="code"><pre>
% java -jar ProductClient.jar --send \
	--source=us \
	--type=dyfi \
	--code=EVENTID \
	--directory=DYFIPRODUCTCONTENTS \
	--privateKey=PRIVATEKEYFILE \
	--eventsource=EVENTNETWORK \
	--eventsourcecode=EVENTCODE \
	--eventtime=2010-10-25T15:10:24Z \
	--latitude=12.345 \
	--longitude=23.456 \
	--property-num-responses=17000
</pre></div>

<p>In the above example, a <i>dyfi</i> product is sent. Source, Type, and
Code uniquely identify this product. Directory contains all the product
files. The Private Key is used to sign the message. Event properties
eventsource, eventsourcecode, eventtime, latitude, longitude are all
included. In addition, a dyfi specific property "num-responses" is
included that indicates how many people have filled out the dyfi
questionaire.</p>


<h4>Deleting a previously sent Product</h4>
<p>To delete a product, reuse the same source, type, and code, and
set the status to DELETE using the --delete argument.</p>
<p><em>Line continuation characters (\) added for readability,
all arguments would appear on one line.</em></p>

<div class="code"><pre>
% java -jar ProductClient.jar --send \
	--source=us \
	--type=dyfi \
	--code=EVENTCODE \
	--eventid=EVENTCODE \
	--delete \
	--privateKey=PRIVATEKEYFILE
</pre></div>

<p>In the above example, a dyfi product is deleted. Source, Type and
Code uniquely identify which product is being deleted. The --delete
argument sets the status to DELETE. The Private Key is used to sign the
message.</p>


<h2 id="signatures">Product Signatures</h2>
<p>Product Senders use an OpenSSH DSA keypair used to sign and
verify their products.</p>

<h3>Creating a new Keypair</h3>
<div class="code"><pre>
ssh-keygen -t dsa -b 1024 -C 'Comment describing key' -f &lt;keyfilename&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>Do not assign a key passphrase. This creates two files: a private
key named "&lt;keyfilename&gt;" and a public key named
"&lt;keyfilename&gt;.pub"</p>
<p>As with all public/private keypairs, NEVER share your PRIVATE
key.</p>
<p>Give your PUBLIC key to everyone who needs to verify your product
signatures.</p>


<h3>Using the Keypair</h3>
<p>The private key is used by the sender when sending products, and
the public key is used by receivers when verifying products.</p>

<h4>Signing products with the private key</h4>
<p>Use the "--privateKey=&lt;keyfilename&gt;" argument when --send ing
products.</p>

<h4>Configuring signature verification with the public key</h4>
<p>This will check signatures before processing a product.</p>

<p>Update the ProductStorage configuration:</p>
<div class="code"><pre>
[my_storage]
...
verifySignatures = true
keychain = ..., key_&lt;keyfilename&gt;

[key_&lt;keyfilename&gt;]
type = gov.usgs.earthquake.distribution.ProductKey
types = &lt;producttype&gt;
sources = &lt;productsource&gt;
key = &lt;public key contents&gt;
</pre></div>

<h3>How is the signature generated and verified?</h3>
<p>Both the sender and receiver compute a SHA-1 digest of all
product contents and metadata (except the signature).</p>

<p>A sender uses their private key to encrypt this digest, and sends
the encrypted digest as the signature.</p>

<p>A receiver uses the senders public key to decrypt the signature
(only the senders public key is able to decrypt the signature). The
receiver then compares the computed digest to the sender's digest.</p>

<p>If the sender and receiver digests match, the signature is
verified and the content is what was originally sent. If the sender and
receiver digests DON'T match, the product is not what was originally
sent, or was signed using a different key.</p>


<h2 id="compression">Compression</h2>

<p>Depending on the type of content	your product contains
	(text/binary/compressed binary), transfer compression can significantly
	decrease network usage.  However, this is a trade off between available CPU and
	network bandwidth.</p>

<p>A general rule is text or uncompressed binary content should use compression;
	compressed binary content should not use additional compression.
	You can read how to configure your transfer on the
	<a href="configuration.html#ProductSender">ProductSender configuration</a>.</p>


<p>You can use the DeflateComparison utility test content you expect to send:</p>
<div class="code"><pre>
java -cp ProductClient.jar gov.usgs.earthquake.distribution.DeflateComparison FILE [FILE ...]
<pre></div>
Where FILE(s) are files or directories that are part of your product content.
