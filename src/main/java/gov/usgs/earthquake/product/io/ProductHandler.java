/**
 * A Handler for Product events.
 *
 * Outputs handle a stream of product events so products can be processed using
 * streams. They usually receive product events via a ProductInput.
 * ProductInputs should attempt to be ordered for uniform processing:
 * <ol>
 * <li>onBeginProduct()
 * <li>onProperty(), by property name alphabetically
 * <li>onLink(), by relation alphabetically, by URI alphabetically
 * <li>onContent(), by content path alphabetically.
 * <li>onSignature()
 * <li>onEndProduct()
 * </ol>
 *
 * Typically a ProductHandler is used to output a single product, although there
 * is no explicit requirement preventing reuse.
