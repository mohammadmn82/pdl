<h1>Indexer</h1>
<p><a href="receiving.html">&laquo; Back to Receiving Documentation</a></p>

<p><a href="../indexer.html">Also see this page describing Indexer Processing</a></p>

<p>The Indexer maintains an index of received products. It uses this
index to associate related products into events, based on eventid or
time, latitude, and longitude. When multiple sources submit information
for the same event, the indexer determines which source is considered
preferred for that type of information.</p>

<h2>The Index</h2>
<p>The index is typically a database, although it is not required to
be. The default implementation uses JDBC, and should be able to maintain
an index in any JDBC compliant database.</p>

<h2>Archive Policies</h2>
<p>Archive policies define rules for when the indexer should remove
information from its index.</p>

<h2>Search</h2>
<p><em>Enabled by default.</em> The indexer listens on a socket to
allow external users to search and retrieve information from The Index.</p>
<p>See the command line client <code>--search</code> option, or
SearchSocket API class.</p>
<p>Searches and results use an XML format. See
etc/schema/indexer.xsd for details.</p>


<h2>Indexer Events</h2>
<p>When a product arrives and is added to the index, the indexer
keeps track of the changes it makes. Each Indexer Event is a group of
one or more changes that were made in response to one product arriving.</p>

<p>This tracking is performed through an onEventTrigger database trigger. For
a technical description of this trigger and instructions for implementing it
on the MySQL database, see <a href="configureMySQL.html">Configuring the Product
Index to Use MySQL</a>
</p>

<a name="change_types"></a>
<h3>Change Types</h3>
<dl>
	<dt>EVENT_ADDED</dt>
	<dd>An event was added to the index. This occurs when a product
	arrives that cannot associate to an existing event, but has enough
	information (time, latitude, longitude) to create a new event.

	<dl>
		<dt>EVENT_SPLIT</dt>
		<dd>An event that was part of another event in the index, in now
		considered a separate event. This usually occurs when a network
		updates is location far enough away from the "parent" event.<br />
		<br />
		There may be several EVENT_SPLIT changes, but there will always also
		be an EVENT_UPDATED for the event that the split events were split
		from.</dd>
	</dl>
	</dd>

	<dt>EVENT_UPDATED</dt>
	<dd>An event that already existed in the index was updated. This
	occurs when a product arrives and associates to an existing event. This
	does not necessarily mean the preferred event properties (eventid,
	time, latitude, longitude, magnitude, depth) have changed, only that
	information associated to this event is different than before.</dd>

	<dt>EVENT_DELETED</dt>
	<dd>An event that already existed in the index was deleted. This
	effectively means the event did not occur. This occurs when a product
	arrives, associates to an existing event, and because of the new
	information the event no longer has a time, latitude, or longitude.

	<dl>
		<dt>EVENT_MERGED</dt>
		<dd>An event that already existed in the index merged with
		another event. This means this event still occured, but is now part of
		another event (and is not preferred).<br /><br />
		There may be several EVENT_MERGED changes, but there will always also
		be an EVENT_UPDATED for the event that the merged events were merged
		into.</dd>
	</dl>
	</dd>

	<dt>EVENT_ARCHIVED</dt>
	<dd>An event was removed from the index due to a configured
	archive policy. The event still occured, but is no longer being tracked
	by this indexer.</dd>

	<dt>PRODUCT_ADDED</dt>
	<dd>A product arrived, was unable to associate to an event, and
	did not have enough information (time, latitude, longitude) to create a
	new event.</dd>

	<dt>PRODUCT_UPDATED</dt>
	<dd>An unassociated product was updated. If an update causes the
	product to associate, there will be an EVENT_UPDATED change instead of
	PRODUCT_UPDATED.</dd>

	<dt>PRODUCT_DELETED</dt>
	<dd>An unassociated product was deleted.</dd>

	<dt>PRODUCT_ARCHIVED</dt>
	<dd>An unassociated product was removed from the index due to a
	configured archive policy.</dd>

</dl>


<h2>Example Indexer Configuration File</h2>
<p>In this example, an indexer is configured to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Download "origin" and "shakemap-input" type products</li>
	<li>Call a listener named "shakemap_listener" whenever an event's
	preferred mag,lat,lon,depth, or time change, which triggers an
	executable script "/home/shake/bin/ProductClient/trigger_pdl".</li>
	<li>Automatically clean up old versions of products, and events
	after 60 days</li>
</ul>


<div class="code"><pre>

; which would be required for sending products.

<h2>Indexer Summarization</h2>
<p>As an aid to indexing, the Indexer maintains a <i>product summary</i>
of products, associating them to seismic events using time, latitude and
longitude. Using these three attributes, the Indexer assigns an <i>eventID</i>
to the summaries, so that multiple products can be efficiently cross-referenced
to a single event.</p>

<p>As part of the summarization process, the Indexer extracts a specific subset
of properties from various products, so that important key aspects of an event
are visible without having to interrogate the details of multiple products.
</p>

<h3>Summarized Properties</h3>
<p>The following properties are extracted from products and are associated with
summarizations of events:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>region</dt>
	<dd>The name of a particular geographic region. Initially the Indexer makes an
	attempt at obtaining the region directly from the <i>origin</i> or
	<i>geoserve</i> products. Failing that, it derives the region using the event's
	latitude and longitude.  This derivation is performed by the <i>feplus</i> feature
	of the Indexer, where individual regions are defined by latitude/longitude
	within the <i>etc/config/regions.xml</i> file.</dd>

	<dt>maxmmi</dt>
	<dd>The maximum shaking intensity found in the <i>shakemap</i> product, although
	maxmmi is directly obtained from the <i>losspager</i> product. If not available
	from losspager, then  maxmmi is obtained from the <i>dyfi</i> product.</dd>

	<dt>alertlevel</dt>
	<dd>A categorized fatality or economic loss level, obtained from the
	<i>losspager</i> product.:
		<dl>
			<dt>Green</dt>
			<dd>0 fatalities OR less than 1 million U.S. dollars economic loss.</dd>
			<dt>Yellow</dt>
			<dd>1-99 fatalities OR less than 100 million U.S. dollars economic loss.</dd>
			<dt>Orange</dt>
			<dd>100-999 fatalities OR less than 1 billion U.S. dollars economic loss.</dd>
			<dt>Red</dt>
			<dd>1000+ fatalities OR greater than 1 billion U.S. dollars economic loss.</dd>
		</dl>
	</dd>

	<dt>review_status</dt>
	<dd>Whether this event has been reviewed by a human, obtained from the
	<i>origin</i> product.</dd>

	<dt>event_type</dt>
	<dd>The type of event, such as <i>earthquake</i> or <i>landslide</i>,  obtained
	from the <i>origin</i> product.</dd>

	<dt>azimuthal_gap</dt>
	<dd>Azimuthal Gap is obtained from the <i>origin</i> product.</dd>

	<dt>magnitude</dt>
	<dd>Magnitude is obtained from the <i>origin</i> product.</dd>


	<dt>num_Resp</dt>
	<dd>The number of individuals completing the DYFI web dialogue for this event,
	obtained from the nresponses attribute of the event_data.xml file included in
	the <i>dyfi</i> product.</dd>

	<dt>tsunamiFlag</dt>
	<dd>A [&ldquo;true&rdquo;|&ldquo;false&rdquo;] Boolean string indicating if
	the tsunami flag should be triggered automatically, obtained from the
	<i>geoserve</i> product.</dd>

	<dt>utcOffset</dt>
	<dd>Number of minutes between the epicenter timezone and UTC, obtained
	from the <i>geoserve</i> product.</dd>

	<dt>significance</dt>
	<dd>
	An integer value indicating the significance of an event, calculated
	from properties of the <i>origin</i>, <i>losspager</i> and <i>dyfi</i>
	products.

	<p>Significance is calculated from the following multi-step formula:</p>

	<dl>
			<dt>magnitude_significance</dt>
			<dd>= (100/6.5) * magnitude<sup>2</sup></dd>

			<dt>pager_significance</dt>
			<dd>= &nbsp;2000 if red&nbsp;&nbsp; 1000 if orange&nbsp;&nbsp;500 if yellow</dd>

			<dt>dyfi_significance</dt>
			<dd>= MIN(num_Resp, 1000) * maxmmi * 0.10</dd>

			<dt>significance</dt>
			<dd>= MAX(magnitude_significance, pager_significance) + dyfi_significance</dd>
	</dl>
	</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Product Summarized Preferred Weight</h3>
<p>Within each type of product, the summary with the largest preferred weight is
considered preferred. This calculated weight is the sum of four components:</p>
<dl>
			<dt>DEFAULT_PREFERRED_WEIGHT = 1</dt>
			<dd>All product summaries have a preferred weight of at least 1.</dd>

			<dt>SAME_SOURCE_WEIGHT = 5</dt>
			<dd>Weight added when product source is same as event source.</dd>

			<dt>AUTHORITATIVE_WEIGHT = 100</dt>
			<dd>Weight added when product author is in the product's authoritative
			region.</dd>

			<dt>AUTHORITATIVE_EVENT_WEIGHT = 50</dt>
			<dd>Weight added when product refers to an authoritative event.</dd>
	</dl>


<h2 id="modules">Indexer Components</h2>
<h3>Indexer SQL Dependencies</h3>
<p>
	The Indexer is dependent on two SQL components: the <i>feplus</i> system and
	<i>OnEventUpdate</i> stored procedures:
</p>

<dl>
		<dt>mysql_feplus</dt>
		<dd>Found in the <i>schema/mysql_feplus</i> directory, feplus implements
		region-identifying functionality based on latitude and longitude. It uses
		the definitions in the <i>etc/config/regions.xml</i> file to associate a
		region-name with a particular latitude/longitude location of an event or
		product. OnEventUpdate stored procedures uses this functionality for
		<i>origin</i> and <i>geoserve</i> products, which ultimately determine
		properties such as event <i>significance</i>.</dd>

		<dt>onEventTrigger Stored Procedures</dt>
		<dd>Found in the <i>schema/productIndexOnEventUpdateMysql.sql</i> file,
		these procedures summarize products and events for efficient retrieval.
		The trigger is evoked when the Indexer's Java classes use
		time/latitude/longitude information in products to create or modify events.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Some Major Java Components</h3>
<dl>
		<dt>JDBCProductIndex</dt>
		<dd>This class implements the ProductIndex interface to maintain events,
		product summaries, event summaries and properties. It contains and executes
		the SQL manipulations of the database.</dd>

		<dt>Indexer</dt>
		<dd>This key class uses JDBCProductIndex to maintain the database, as well
		as adds and removes listeners, receives products and sends notifications. It
		extends the DefaultNotificationListener class.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Indexer Modules</h3>
<p>Specific products sometimes have special needs for indexing; the three existing
product type of this nature are the <i>shakemap</i>, <i>dyfi</i>, and
<i>moment-tensor</i> products. This special indexing is configured in
<i>config.ini</i>, as is documented in the
<a href="configuration.html#indexerconfig">Indexer Components</a> section of the
configuration documentation and illustrated below.</p>
<p>The following code snippet from <i>config.ini</i> shows the minimum entries
necessary for requesting special indexing for the shakemap and dyfi products:</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
[indexer]
modules = indexer_module_shakemap, indexer_module_dyfi

[indexer_module_shakemap]
type = gov.usgs.earthquake.shakemap.ShakeMapIndexerModule

[indexer_module_dyfi]
type = gov.usgs.earthquake.dyfi.DYFIIndexerModule

[indexer_module_momenttensor]
type = gov.usgs.earthquake.momenttensor.MTIndexerModule

</pre></div>

<ul>
	<li>
		The <i>modules =</i> line creates labels for further shakemap and
		dyfi definition.
	</li>
	<li>
		The <i>[indexer_module_shakemap]</i>, <i>[indexer_module_dyfi]</i>,
		and <i>[indexer_module_momenttensor]</i> lines mark the start of those
		definitions.
	</li>
	<li>
		The three <i>type =</i> lines specify the Java code classes that will handle
		the special indexing for those three product types.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>As has been noted elsewhere in this documentation, the custom programming of
these special indexing classes requires coordination between the product producer
and the PDL web team at <a href="mailto:jmfee@usgs.gov">jmfee@usgs.gov</a>.</p>

<dl>
		<dt>gov.usgs.earthquake.shakemap.ShakeMapIndexerModule</dt>
		<dd>This class implements the ProductIndex interface to maintain events,
		product summaries, event summaries and properties. It contains and executes
		the SQL manipulations of the database.</dd>

		<dt>gov.usgs.earthquake.dyfi.DYFIIndexerModule</dt>
		<dd>This key class uses JDBCProductIndex to maintain the database, as well
		as adds and removes listeners, receives products and sends notifications. It
		extends the DefaultNotificationListener class.</dd>

		<dt>gov.usgs.earthquake.momenttensor.MTIndexerModule</dt>
		<dd>
			This class adjusts the weight of moment tensor products.
